TECHNOLOGIES
1. Knockout JS - MVVM design pattern.
2. Bootstrap - not great since it doesn't solve responsive design, i.e. video doesn't resize, elements overlap, etc.
Still have to mess around with media queries.
3. Google Maps API
4. Google Youtube API

FUNCTIONALITY
1. Open page to run app. All places will show and default video will play.
2. Search to filter by name of place. The app will only match the first 3 letters of your key phrase so that at least some results appear.
3. To activate a place, either click on a marker or a button in  the list.
4. Once a place is activated, a corresponding video will play.
